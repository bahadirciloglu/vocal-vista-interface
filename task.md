# AssemblyAI Voice Assistant Project â€“ Task List & Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Set up project repository and version control (e.g., GitHub)
- [x] Define project structure for frontend
- [x] Configure environment variables for API keys (AssemblyAI, LLM, etc.)
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
    - [x] Add workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml) for automated test and deploy

---

## 2. Frontend Development
- [x] Design and implement the main UI (see design.md wireframe)
    - [x] Conversation window
    - [x] Microphone button
    - [x] Real-time transcription display
    - [x] Status indicator (listening, processing, speaking)
    - [x] Accessibility features (high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [x] Implement audio capture from microphone
- [x] Implement audio playback for TTS responses
- [x] Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile
- [x] Integrate with external APIs:
    - [x] Call /stt, /chat, /tts endpoints from the frontend (these APIs are not implemented locally, but are called externally when the user clicks relevant buttons or as part of the conversation flow)

---

## 3. Backend Development
- [ ] (Not implemented in this project) All API endpoints (/stt, /chat, /tts) are called externally.

---

## 4. AssemblyAI Integration
- [x] Integrate AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming STT for real-time speech-to-text
    - [x] Configure for low latency (<300ms)
    - [ ] (Optional) Set up custom vocabulary for domain-specific terms
    - [ ] (Optional) Enable speaker detection and PII redaction
- [x] Integrate AssemblyAI TTS for text-to-speech
    - [ ] (Optional) Support multiple voices/languages if required
- [ ] (Optional) Use AssemblyAI sentiment analysis and content moderation APIs

---

## 5. LLM & External API Integration
- [x] Integrate LLM (Gemini, OpenAI, or custom backend) via external API
    - [x] Pass transcribed text and chat history for context-aware responses
    - [ ] (Optional) Integrate Qloo API or other external APIs for recommendations
- [x] Handle LLM response formatting and error cases

---

## 6. User Experience & Accessibility
- [x] Ensure low end-to-end latency (<1s, ideally <300ms for streaming)
- [x] Implement clear error feedback for users
- [x] Test and optimize for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- [x] Provide high-contrast and multi-device support

---

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for frontend API calls and UI
- [x] Test frontend UI/UX across devices and browsers
- [ ] Simulate real-world conversation flows (see design.md sample)
- [ ] Monitor latency, accuracy, and error rates

---

## 8. Deployment & Monitoring
- [x] Deploy frontend to production (e.g., Vercel, Render, AWS)
- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring for API usage, latency, and errors
- [x] Document setup, usage, and troubleshooting steps

---

## 9. Documentation & Handover
- [x] Finalize and maintain requirements.md and design.md
- [x] Provide user and developer documentation
- [x] Prepare demo and presentation materials (if for hackathon/portfolio)

---

## 10. Optional/Advanced Tasks
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Integrate analytics and logging dashboard
- [ ] Expand with additional external APIs (e.g., hotel booking, CRM)
- [ ] Enhance personalization and context retention
