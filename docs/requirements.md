# AssemblyAI Voice Assistant Project – Requirements

---

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

- **Voice Input:**
  - The system must accept real-time or recorded voice input from users (microphone, phone, etc.).

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
  - Integrate AssemblyAI’s Universal-Streaming (or standard) STT API to transcribe user speech to text with low latency and high accuracy.

- **Intent/Response Generation (LLM):**
  - The transcribed text must be sent to an LLM (e.g., Gemini) for intent detection, question answering, or recommendations.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - The LLM’s response must be converted back to audio using AssemblyAI’s TTS API (or another TTS provider) and played to the user.

- **Conversational Context:**
  - Maintain chat history/context for multi-turn conversations.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handle STT, LLM, or TTS failures and provide fallback responses.

## 2. Technical Requirements

- **AssemblyAI API Key:**
  - Securely store and use your AssemblyAI API key for all API calls.

- **Real-Time Streaming:**
  - For live assistants, use AssemblyAI’s Universal-Streaming API for sub-300ms latency.

- **Custom Vocabulary:** _(Optional)_
  - Use AssemblyAI’s custom vocabulary feature for domain-specific terms.

- **Speaker Detection:** _(Optional)_
  - Enable speaker detection for multi-user scenarios.

- **PII Redaction:** _(Optional)_
  - Use PII redaction for privacy-sensitive applications.

- **Language Support:**
  - Ensure the chosen STT and TTS models support the required languages.

- **Frontend:**
  - Web, mobile, or desktop interface for capturing voice and playing audio responses.

- **Backend:**
  - Server (e.g., Node.js, Python/FastAPI) to orchestrate STT, LLM, and TTS calls.

- **Security:**
  - Use HTTPS for all API calls. Do not expose API keys in the frontend.

- **Scalability:**
  - Design for concurrent users if needed (e.g., via WebSockets, LiveKit, etc.).

## 3. User Experience Requirements

- **Low Latency:**
  - End-to-end response time should be <1 second (ideally <300ms for streaming).

- **Accessibility:**
  - Support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast UI.

- **Multi-Device Support:**
  - Should work on desktop, mobile, and (optionally) smart speakers.

- **Error Feedback:**
  - Inform users of any issues (e.g., “Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Please repeat.”).

---

## 4. Optional/Advanced Requirements

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Use AssemblyAI’s sentiment analysis for emotional context.

- **Content Moderation:**
  - Filter inappropriate content in user input or LLM output.

- **Analytics & Logging:**
  - Track usage, errors, and performance metrics.

- **Multi-Language Support:**
  - Allow users to interact in multiple languages.

- **Integration with External APIs:**
  - (e.g., Qloo, hotel booking, CRM, etc.) for richer responses.

---

## 5. Deployment & Operations

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Automated testing and deployment.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Real-time monitoring of API usage, latency, and errors.

- **Documentation:**
  - Clear setup, usage, and troubleshooting documentation.

## Summary

To build an AssemblyAI voice assistant, you need robust STT and TTS integration, a conversational backend (LLM), a secure and responsive frontend, and attention to privacy, accessibility, and scalability. Optional features like custom vocabulary, sentiment analysis, and external API integration can further enhance your assistant.
