# AssemblyAI Voice Assistant Project – Task List & Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Set up project repository and version control (e.g., GitHub)
- [ ] Define project structure for frontend and backend
- [ ] Configure environment variables for API keys (AssemblyAI, LLM, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

---

## 2. Frontend Development
- [ ] Design and implement the main UI (see design.md wireframe)
    - [ ] Conversation window
    - [ ] Microphone button (start/stop voice input)
    - [ ] Real-time transcription display
    - [ ] Status indicator (listening, processing, speaking)
    - [ ] Accessibility features (high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Implement audio capture from microphone
- [ ] Implement audio playback for TTS responses
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile

---

## 3. Backend Development
- [ ] Set up backend server (Node.js, Python/FastAPI, etc.)
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
    - [ ] /stt – handle audio stream to AssemblyAI STT
    - [ ] /chat – send transcribed text and chat history to LLM (e.g., Gemini, Qloo+LLM)
    - [ ] /tts – send LLM response to AssemblyAI TTS and return audio URL
- [ ] Manage chat history/context for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Implement user/session management (if needed)
- [ ] Secure API keys and enforce HTTPS

---

## 4. AssemblyAI Integration
- [ ] Integrate AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming STT for real-time speech-to-text
    - [ ] Configure for low latency (<300ms)
    - [ ] (Optional) Set up custom vocabulary for domain-specific terms
    - [ ] (Optional) Enable speaker detection and PII redaction
- [ ] Integrate AssemblyAI TTS for text-to-speech
    - [ ] Support multiple voices/languages if required
- [ ] (Optional) Use AssemblyAI sentiment analysis and content moderation APIs

---

## 5. LLM & External API Integration
- [ ] Integrate LLM (Gemini, OpenAI, or custom backend)
    - [ ] Pass transcribed text and chat history for context-aware responses
    - [ ] (Optional) Integrate Qloo API or other external APIs for recommendations
- [ ] Handle LLM response formatting and error cases

---

## 6. User Experience & Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure low end-to-end latency (<1s, ideally <300ms for streaming)
- [ ] Implement clear error feedback for users
- [ ] Test and optimize for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Provide high-contrast and multi-device support

---

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend endpoints
- [ ] Test frontend UI/UX across devices and browsers
- [ ] Simulate real-world conversation flows (see design.md sample)
- [ ] Monitor latency, accuracy, and error rates

---

## 8. Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend to production (e.g., Vercel, Render, AWS)
- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring for API usage, latency, and errors
- [ ] Document setup, usage, and troubleshooting steps

---

## 9. Documentation & Handover
- [ ] Finalize and maintain requirements.md and design.md
- [ ] Provide user and developer documentation
- [ ] Prepare demo and presentation materials (if for hackathon/portfolio)

---

## 10. Optional/Advanced Tasks
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Integrate analytics and logging dashboard
- [ ] Expand with additional external APIs (e.g., hotel booking, CRM)
- [ ] Enhance personalization and context retention
